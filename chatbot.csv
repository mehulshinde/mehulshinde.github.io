Tell me about your internships,"Software Engineer Intern, Copart Inc. (Aug-Dec 2019) IT Intern, Farm Bureau Financial Services (Aug-Dec 2018) Software Development Intern, RenterGate (May-Aug 2018) Software Development Intern, LESEM Lab (May-Aug 2017)"
Tell me about yourself,"I am always in awe of new technology and consider myself a tech geek. I have experience developing software for research projects, start-ups, and enterprise as part of internships and jobs in my time at Iowa State University. I wrote my first Java program when I was 11 and have been awestruck by the impact technology can create on the world and the number of lives a piece of software can affect. Post completion of my Master's degree at Carnegie Mellon University I would like to develop technology that is not only used by hundreds and thousands of individuals but also impacts them in a positive way. "
Tell me about a challenge you faced,"Copart Inc. was my first back-end focused internship. The very first task I was assigned was to develop a proof-of-concept to improve the performance and utility of the existing message queue used in the Accounting and Revenue Management department. Having no background in either accounting, the mentioned technologies, or the existing system, I was not even sure where to start, let alone improve the performance of any part of the system. I was however thrilled that I was responsible for working on something that would be impactful for not only my team but the entire company. Hence, I decided to take the opportunity to learn something new and accomplish the task at hand. Over the week, I researched message queues and the way they were used in the system. I also developed toy projects that would simulate the behavior of message queues in the system. With some elaborate discussions with my very supportive manager, I was able to develop a proof-of-concept using a completely new approach and technology - Apache Kafka. The management eventually decided to make a change in the system and incorporate my proof-of-concept at scale. I then assisted the senior developers in applying my proof-of-concept to the system that is responsible for processing approximately $12 billion."
